# Installations

*** It's easier to use homebrew for most of your Mac installations when building a django application

e.g. brew install wget

*** Itâ€™s all Git and Ruby underneath, so hack away with the knowledge that you can easily revert your modifications and merge upstream updates.

for example; brew edit wget # opens in $EDITOR!

Homebrew formulae are simple Ruby scripts:

class Wget < Formula
  homepage "https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"
  url "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.15.tar.gz"
  sha256 "52126be8cf1bddd7536886e74c053ad7d0ed2aa89b4b630f76785bac21695fcd"

  def install
    system "./configure", "--prefix=#{prefix}"
    system "make", "install"
  end
end
